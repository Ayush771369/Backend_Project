This is a Markdown file converter which converts the .md (Markdow file) into a .html (A HTML File) by using thee marked library in nodejs.
For uploading files I have used busboy library of nodejs, path library for working with files and directory paths. 
For the basic frontend i have used the ejs library.
For running the project you just have to type localhost:4001 on the browser, then it will ask you to upload a file. After uploading a .md file it will return a html file which you can download.
